Introduction:
NEUROFLOW is an application designed to offer an intuitive and interactive way of building and training neural network models. It simplifies the process of neural network configuration and enables real-time visualization of training progress. The user-friendly GUI, built with SvelteKit, provides options for selecting neural network architectures, adjusting the number of layers and neurons, and choosing activation functions. During training, users can monitor metrics such as loss and accuracy through real-time graphs.

Features:

Neural Network Configuration:
Configure the structure of your neural network with ease. Options include setting the number of layers, neurons, and activation functions.

Real-Time Training Insights:
