NEUROFLOW
Introduction
This application offers an intuitive and interactive way to build and train neural network models. It is designed to simplify the process of configuring neural networks and visualizing their training progress in real-time. The GUI, built with SvelteKit, allows users to select neural network architectures, including the number of layers, number of neurons, and activation functions. During the training phase, users can observe real-time graphs showing various metrics such as loss and accuracy.
